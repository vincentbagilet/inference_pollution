# Purpose of the document

In this document, discuss the "theory" behind our simulations and the overall implementation for these simulations.

# Data

We use data from 68 cities in the US over the 1987-1997 period. This data is a subset of the US National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). The data set contains records of deaths, mean concentration data for carbon monoxide (CO), temperature data and calendar control variables (such as school holidays for instance). All variables are at the daily and city level. There is therefore a unique observation per date and per city in the data set.

# Background on selected quasi-experiments

Note that, for now we focus on quasi experiments for which treatment is binary and homogeneous, both in time and across individuals. Treatment is also not correlated with covariates (apart for air pollution alerts in which case treatement is of course correlated with the pollutant level).

## Treatment on "random" days

Here, we consider interventions leading to changes in air pollution levels on some random days. Examples of such interventions include transportation strikes. Of course, dates are often not defined as random and are likely to be correlated with unobserved variables. In the present setting, we first consider the golden standard case in which these days are actually defined at random. One can think of this case as a Randomized Control Trial: it represents what would happen if an  experimenter could implement a treatment increasing pollution on random days.

## Air pollution alert

Here we consider interventions that affect exposure to air pollution when air pollution levels reach a given threshold. Examples of such interventions include air pollution alerts: when pollution reaches a certain level, alerts are released, inviting people to reduce their exposure.

## No quasi experiment

We finally consider a case for which there is no quasi experiment. One can consider that in this case all units are treated. To measure the effect of air pollution on health in this case, we will use methods from the epidemiology literature, as discussed in the next section.

# Identification method

In order to estimate the parameters of interest, we use several identification methods. Most quasi-experiments are associated with a given identification method.

## RCT-type

The effect of a treatment on random days is estimated using a RCT type of model. The overall idea of the RCT is to compare the average number of deaths or hospital admissions in cities with treatment to cities with no treatment on the same day, controlling for differences across cities. 

This identification method enables to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), *ie* a difference in mean between the treated and the control group ($\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]$). To do so, we use the following type of model:

$$Y_{ct} = \alpha + \beta D_{ct} + \epsilon_{ct}$$
where, as in the whole document, $Y_{ct}$ is the health outcome of interest (for instance mortality), in a city $c$, at date $t$. The parameter of interest is $\beta$ and $D_{ct}$ is a dummy equal to 1 if the city $c$ is treated at time $t$ and 0 otherwise.

The identification assumption here is that the the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment (independence assumption).

## Instrumental variable

In all previous identification methods, we only tried to estimate a reduced form, *ie* looking at the effect of a treatment directly on mortality. We did not consider the effect of the treatment on air pollution, *ie* the mechanism. In this section, we instrument the effect of pollution on the outcome with an instrument/treatment. We basically model the effect of an exogeneous instrument on air pollution and use this information to retrieve a causal estimate of the short term effect of air pollution on health. Note that the class of treatments/instruments considered here is broader than in the previous section. 

In a first step, we only consider binary instruments such as thermal inversions and high/low wind speed for instance. This type of instruments corresponds to a large share of the instruments considered in the literature. The key assumption is that these treatments only affect the health outcome variable via their effect on air pollution. 

Let's denote $Z$ this instrument. We compute a 2-Stages Least Squares (2SLS) where the first stage has the form:

$$Poll_{ct} = \gamma + \delta Z_{ct} + e_{ct}$$
and the second stage:

$$Y_{ct} = \alpha + \beta Poll_{ct} + \epsilon_{ct}$$

## Linear model

Finally, we also consider simple linear models in order to measure the correlation between the health outcome of interest and air pollution, controlling for potential confouders. The identification assumptions here are the usual OLS assumptions.

We estimate a model of the form:

$$Y_{ct} = \alpha + \beta Poll_{ct} + \epsilon_{ct}$$

# Analysis

## Overall setting

To sum up the analysis, the aim is to measure the inference properties of different research designs aiming at measuring the short-term effects of air pollution on health. For simplicity, consider the daily number of death as the output variable of interest for now. We proceed as follows:

1. We define the length of the study period, *ie* the number of observations, and a true effect size, $\beta_0$, representing the percentage change in the number of deaths in response to the treatment.
1. We draw a study period randomly
1. We define the treated days, *ie* we define a treatment variable $T_{ct}$ equal to 1 if the city $c$ is treated at time $t$ and zero otherwise. 
1. We compute the number of deaths when treated for each  observation ($Y(1)$) based on the "true" effect of the treatment. We then derive $Y_{obs} = Y(0) × (1-T) + Y(1) × T$.
1. We estimate our model with $Y_{obs}$ as a dependent variable and retrieve $\hat{\beta}$ and the associated p-value.
1. We run the steps 2 to 5 $n_{iter}$ times.
1. We compute the average bias, type M, type S and power.

<!-- In the potential outcome framework, we have $Y_{ct}(0)$, the number of deaths if a city $c$ is not treated at time $t$ equal to $h_{ct}$ and $Y_{ct}(1)$, the number of deaths if this city is treated, equal to $(1 + \beta_0)h_{ct}$. We build our setting, so that we can "observe" both outcomes. The estimation is performed on the fake observed data $Y_{obs} = h^{fake}$ and we have -->
<!-- $Y_{obs} = Y(0) × (1-T) + Y(1) × T$.  -->

## Varying "parameters"

Note that there are several parameters we can vary in order to evaluate the performance of the different methods: the identification strategy, the number of observations, the proportion of treated days, the true effect size and the model. In order to limit the number of simulations and for clarity, we only modify one parameter at the time, keeping others constant and equal to a baseline value. When we vary a parameter, we consider the following values:

- Number of observations: we actually vary the length of the study, in days. The number of observations is approximately equal to the number of days in the study times the number of cities. We consider 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 days **because** ...
- Proportion of treated days: 0.1, 0.5. The proportion of days treated matters since, while the number of observations can be large, the number of treated days may remain very small (*eg* the number of strikes). We choose these values **because** ...
- Effect size: 0.15%, 0.5% and 1% **because** ...
- The estimation model: we first do not include covariates, only fixed effects. We then include include different sets of covariates.

We consider this set of parameters for each quasi-experiment.
