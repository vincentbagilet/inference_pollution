In this document, we download a subsample of the pollution data. To do so, we use the `europollution` package.

# Definition subsample

We choose to consider a subsample of 10%  of  air  pollution  stations (610 stations), randomly selected. The analysis focuses on a 5 years period, 2013-2018.

```{r}
set.seed(12)

# metadata <- ep_metadata() 
# save(metadata, file = "../Outputs/metadata.Rda")

load("../Outputs/metadata.Rda")

stations_id <- metadata$AirQualityStation %>% unique() 
subsample_stations_ids <- sample(stations_id, floor(length(stations_id)/10))

# save(subsample_stations_ids, file = "../Outputs/subsample_stations_ids.Rda")
```

# Download, rangle and clean data


```{r}
raw_subsample_pollution <- ep_download(stations_id = subsample_stations_ids, pollutants = c("O3", "PM10", "PM2.5", "NOx", "NO2", "SO2"), begin = 2013, end = 2018)

save(raw_subsample_pollution, file = "../Outputs/raw_subsample_pollution.Rda")

subsample_pollution <- raw_subsample_pollution %>% 
  ep_wrangle() %>% 
  ep_clean()
```
