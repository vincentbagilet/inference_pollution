  abstract = {Statistical significance is often interpreted as providing greater information than nonsignificance. In this article we show, however, that rejection of a point null often carries very little information, while failure to reject may be highly informative. This is particularly true in empirical contexts that are common in economics, where data-sets are large and there are rarely reasons to put substantial prior probability on a point null. Our results challenge the usual practice of conferring point null rejections a higher level of scientific significance than non-rejections. Therefore, we advocate visible reporting and discussion of nonsignificant results. (JEL C12, C90)},

We propose two approaches for identifying the conditional probability of publication as a function of a study's results, the first based on systematic replication studies and the second on meta-studies. For known conditional publication probabilities, we propose bias-corrected estimators and confidence sets. We apply our methods to recent replication studies in experimental economics and psychology, and to a meta-study on the effect of the minimum wage. When replication and meta-study data are available, we find similar results from both.},

Based on the universe of credit and debit card transactions in China from 2013 to 2015, this paper provides to our knowledge the first analysis of the morbidity cost of PM2.5 for the entire population of a developing country. To address potential endogeneity in pollution exposure, we construct an instrumental variable by modeling the spatial spillovers of PM2.5 due to long-range transport. We propose a flexible distributed-lag model that incorporates the IV approach to capture the dynamic response to past pollution exposure. Our analysis shows that PM2.5 has a significant impact on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms that survives an array of robustness checks. The annual reduction in national healthcare spending from complying with the World Health Organization's annual standard of 10 \textmu g/m3 would amount to \$42 billion, or nearly 7\% of China's total healthcare spending in 2015. In contrast to the common perception that the morbidity impact is modest relative to the mortality impact, our estimated morbidity cost of air pollution is about two-thirds of the mortality cost from the recent literature.},

The method is then generalized to observational studies where treatments were not randomly assigned, so that sensitivity to hidden biases must be examined. Adjustments using an instrumental variable are also discussed. The methods are illustrated using data from two observational studies.},

Repeated scans were done for nearly all participants between 2002 and 2005, for a subset of participants between 2005 and 2007, and for half of all participants between 2010 and 2012. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasound in all participants at baseline and in 2010–12 for 3459 participants. Residence-specific spatio-temporal pollution concentration models, incorporating community-specific measurements, agency monitoring data, and geographical predictors, estimated concentrations of PM$_{\textrm{2·5}}$ and nitrogen oxides (NO$_{\textrm{X}}$) between 1999 and 2012. The primary aim was to examine the association between both progression of coronary artery calcium and mean carotid artery intima-media thickness and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutant concentrations (PM$_{\textrm{2·5}}$, NO$_{\textrm{X}}$, and black carbon) between examinations and within the six metropolitan areas, adjusting for baseline age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, site, and CT scanner technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this population, coronary calcium increased on average by 24 Agatston units per year (SD 58), and intima-media thickness by 12 μm per year (10), before adjusting for risk factors or air pollutant exposures. Participant-specific pollutant concentrations averaged over the years 2000–10 ranged from 9·2–22·6 μg PM$_{\textrm{2·5}}$/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ and 7·2–139·2 parts per billion (ppb) NO$_{\textrm{X}}$. For each 5 μg PM$_{\textrm{2·5}}$/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ increase, coronary calcium progressed by 4·1 Agatston units per year (95\% CI 1·4–6·8) and for each 40 ppb NO$_{\textrm{X}}$ coronary calcium progressed by 4·8 Agatston units per year (0·9–8·7). Pollutant exposures were not associated with intima-media thickness change. The estimate for the effect of a 5 μg/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ higher long-term exposure to PM$_{\textrm{2·5}}$ in intima-media thickness was −0·9 μm per year (95\% CI −3·0 to 1·3).

	abstract = {Rationale: Epidemiologic studies associate atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) pollution with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and increased cardiac mortality risk. However, there is a lack of data regarding cellular mechanisms in healthy individuals.Objectives: To investigate the chronic effects of environmentally relevant CO levels on cardiac function in a well-standardized healthy animal model.Methods : Wistar rats were exposed for 4 weeks to filtered air (CO {\textless} 1 ppm) or air enriched with CO (30 ppm with five peaks of 100 ppm per 24-h period), consistent with urban pollution. Myocardial function was assessed by echocardiography and analysis of surface ECG and in vitro by measuring the excitation-contraction coupling of single left ventricular cardiomyocytes.Measurements and Main Results: Chronic CO pollution promoted left ventricular interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, with no change in cardiomyocyte size, and had weak, yet significant, effects on in vivo cardiac function. However, both contraction and relaxation of single cardiomyocytes were markedly altered. Several changes occurred, including decreased Ca2+ transient amplitude and Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments and increased diastolic intracellular Ca2+ subsequent to decreased SERCA-2a expression and impaired Ca2+ reuptake. CO pollution increased the number of arrhythmic events. Hyperphosphorylation of Ca2+-handling and sarcomeric proteins, and reduced responses to β-adrenergic challenge were obtained, suggestive of moderate CO-induced hyperadrenergic state.Conclusions: Chronic CO exposure promotes a pathological phenotype of cardiomyocytes in the absence of underlying cardiomyopathy. The less severe phenotype in vivo suggests a role for compensatory mechanisms. Arrhythmia propensity may derive from intracellular Ca2+ overload.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The systematic evaluation of the results of time-series studies of air pollution is challenged by differences in model specification and publication bias.
METHODS We evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration–response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived. The authors’ full names, academic degrees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS On average, an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36\% (95\% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47\% (95\% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68\% (95\% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55\% (95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74\% (95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration–response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS Our data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies.

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades, psychological science has experienced an unprecedented replicability crisis, which has uncovered several issues. Among others, the use and misuse of statistical inference plays a key role in this crisis. Indeed, statistical inference is too often viewed as an isolated procedure limited to the analysis of data that have already been collected. Instead, statistical reasoning is necessary both at the planning stage and when interpreting the results of a research project. Based on these considerations, we build on and further develop an idea proposed by Gelman and Carlin (2014) termed “prospective and retrospective design analysis.” Rather than focusing only on the statistical signiﬁcance of a result and on the classical control of type I and type II errors, a comprehensive design analysis involves reasoning about what can be considered a plausible effect size. Furthermore, it introduces two relevant inferential risks: the exaggeration ratio or Type M error (i.e., the predictable average overestimation of an effect that emerges as statistically signiﬁcant) and the sign error or Type S error (i.e., the risk that a statistically signiﬁcant effect is estimated in the wrong direction). Another important aspect of design analysis is that it can be usefully carried out both in the planning phase of a study and for the evaluation of studies that have already been conducted, thus increasing researchers’ awareness during all phases of a research project. To illustrate the beneﬁts of a design analysis to the widest possible audience, we use a familiar example in psychology where the researcher is interested in analyzing the differences between two independent groups considering Cohen’s d as an effect size measure. We examine the case in which the plausible effect size is formalized as a single value, and we propose a method in which uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the effect is formalized via probability distributions. Through several examples and an application to a real case study, we show that, even though a design analysis requires signiﬁcant effort, it has the potential to contribute to planning more robust and replicable studies. Finally, future developments in the Bayesian framework are discussed.},

But identiﬁcation does not necessarily imply that the causal eﬀects can be estimated accurately with limited data. In this paper, we highlight that estimation is particularly challenging with the RD design and investigate how these challenges manifest themselves in the empirical literature. We collect all RD-based ﬁndings published in top political science journals from 2009–2018. The ﬁndings exhibit pathological features; estimates tend to bunch just above the conventional level of statistical signiﬁcance. A reanalysis of all studies with available data suggests that researcher’s discretion is not a major driver of these pathological features, but researchers tend to use inappropriate methods for inference, rendering standard errors artiﬁcially small. A retrospective power analysis reveals that most of these studies were underpowered to detect all but large eﬀects. The issues we uncover, combined with well-documented selection pressures in academic publishing, cause concern that many published ﬁndings using the RD design are exaggerated, if not entirely spurious.},

	abstract = {Background: The opportunity to assess short term impact of air pollution relies on the causal interpretation of the exposure-response association. However, up to now few studies explicitly faced this issue within a causal inference framework. In this paper, we reformulated the problem of assessing the short term impact of air pollution on health using the potential outcome approach to causal inference. We considered the impact of high daily levels of particulate matter ≤10 μm in diameter (PM10) on mortality within two days from the exposure in the metropolitan area of Milan (Italy), during the period 2003–2006. Our research focus was the causal impact of a hypothetical intervention setting daily air pollution levels under a pre-fixed threshold.
Methods: We applied a matching procedure based on propensity score to estimate the total number of attributable deaths (AD) during the study period. After defining the number of attributable deaths in terms of difference between potential outcomes, we used the estimated propensity score to match each high exposure day, namely each day with a level of exposure higher than 40 μg/m3, with a day with similar background characteristics but a level of exposure lower than 40 μg/m3. Then, we estimated the impact by comparing mortality between matched days.
Results: During the study period daily exposures larger than 40 μg/m3 were responsible for 1079 deaths (90\% CI: 116; 2042). The impact was more evident among the elderly than in the younger age classes. Exposures ≥ 40 μg/m3 were responsible, among the elderly, for 1102 deaths (90\% CI: 388, 1816), of which 797 from cardiovascular causes and 243 from respiratory causes. Clear evidence of an impact on respiratory mortality was found also in the age class 65–74, with 87 AD (90\% CI: 11, 163).
Conclusions: The propensity score matching turned out to be an appealing method to assess historical impacts in this field, which guarantees that the estimated total number of AD can be derived directly as sum of either age-specific or cause-specific AD, unlike the standard model-based procedure. For this reason, it is a promising approach to perform surveillance focusing on very specific causes of death or diseases, or on susceptible subpopulations. Finally, the propensity score matching is free from issues concerning the exposure-confounders-mortality modeling and does not involve extrapolation. On the one hand this enhances the internal validity of our results; on the other, it makes the approach scarcely appropriate for estimating future impacts.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting.The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as ‘extreme scenarios’. Finally, we describe problems with a common ‘benchmarking’ practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates.

Editorial page 2431 Supplemental content CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning and CME Questions page 2489 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between short-term exposures to PM2.5 and ozone (mean of daily exposure on the same day of death and 1 day prior) and mortality in 2-pollutant models. The study included the entire Medicare population from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, residing in 39 182 zip codes. EXPOSURES Daily PM2.5 and ozone levels in a 1-km × 1-km grid were estimated using published and validated air pollution prediction models based on land use, chemical transport modeling, and satellite remote sensing data. From these gridded exposures, daily exposures were calculated for every zip code in the United States. Warm-season ozone was defined as ozone levels for the months April to September of each year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality in the entire Medicare population from 2000 to 2012.
RESULTS During the study period, there were 22 433 862 million case days and 76 143 209 control days. Of all case and control days, 93.6\% had PM2.5 levels below 25 μg/m3, during which 95.2\% of deaths occurred (21 353 817 of 22 433 862), and 91.1\% of days had ozone levels below 60 parts per billion, during which 93.4\% of deaths occurred (20 955 387 of 22 433 862). The baseline daily mortality rates were 137.33 and 129.44 (per 1 million persons at risk per day) for the entire year and for the warm season, respectively. Each short-term increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 (adjusted by ozone) and 10 parts per billion (10−9) in warm-season ozone (adjusted by PM2.5) were statistically significantly associated with a relative increase of 1.05\% (95\% CI, 0.95\%-1.15\%) and 0.51\% (95\% CI, 0.41\%-0.61\%) in daily mortality rate, respectively. Absolute risk differences in daily mortality rate were 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.29-1.56) and 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.53-0.78) per 1 million persons at risk per day. There was no evidence of a threshold in the exposure-response relationship.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the US Medicare population from 2000 to 2012, short-term exposures to PM2.5 and warm-season ozone were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. This risk occurred at levels below current national air quality standards, suggesting that these standards may need to be reevaluated.},

Methods: We used the Instrumental Variable (IV) methodology to control for confounding factors affecting hospital admissions.

Data on PM10 concentrations and hospital admissions were compiled for Israel’s two largest cities, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, for 2007–2009. We compared our IV estimates to those derived from a Poisson regression, which is commonly used in the literature.
Results: Sandstorms led to an increase of 307 µg/m3 of PM10 concentrations. A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 is associated with a 0.8\% increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory conditions, using IV methodology. The same finding was noted using the Poisson regression.
Conclusions: The association between PM10 and hospital admission reflects a primarily causal relationship. Instrumental variable methodology could be applied to analyze the effect of air pollution on hospital admissions.},

              INTRODUCTION
              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and
                P
                values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (
                M
                r
                = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (
                M
                r
                = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (
                P
                {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original
                P
                value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.
              
              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

            Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence of causal relationship between mortality of older adults and low- concentration PM2.5 remains limited.
Objectives: This study investigates the effects of low-concentration PM2.5 on the mortality of adults older than 65 using the closure of coal-fired power plants in the Eastern United States as a natural experiment.
Methods: We investigated power plants in the Eastern United States (US) that had production changes through unit shutdown or plant retirement between 1999 and 2013. We included only non-clustered power plants without scrubbers and with capacities greater than 50 MW. We used instrumental variable (IV) and difference-in-differences (DID) approaches to estimate the causal impact of PM2.5 concentrations on mortality among Medicare beneficiaries. We compared changes in monthly age-adjusted mortality before and after the retirement of coal-fired plants between the treated and control counties; we accounted for annual wind direction in our selection of treated and control counties. In the models, we initially included only county and monthly fixed effects, and then adjusted for covariates including: 1) only weather variables (temperature, dew point, pressure); and 2) weather variables and socio-economic variables (median household income and poverty rate).
Results: The monthly age-adjusted mortality rate averaged across all plants was approximately 423 per 100,000 (SD = 69) and was higher for males than females. Mean PM2.5 concentrations across all counties were 12 μg/m3 (SD = 3.78). Using the IV method, we found that reductions in PM2.5 concentrations significantly decreased monthly mortality among older adults. IV results show that a 1-μg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 concentrations leads to 7.17 fewer deaths per 100,000 per month, or a 1.7\% lower monthly mortality rate among people older than 65 years. Using the DID approach, we found that power plant retirement significantly decreased: 1) monthly PM2.5 levels by 2.1 μg/m3, and 2) monthly age-adjusted mortality by approximately 15 people per 100,000 (or 3.6\%) in treated counties relative to control counties. The mortality effects were higher among males than females and its impact was the greatest among people older than 75 years.
Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of local, plant-level control measures in reducing near-plant PM2.5 and mortality among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries.},

	abstract = {Background: The shape of the exposure-response curve describing the effects of air pollution on population health has crucial regulatory implications, and it is important in assessing causal impacts of hypothetical policies of air pollution reduction.
Methods: After having reformulated the problem of assessing the short-term impact of air pollution on health within the potential outcome approach to causal inference, we developed a method based on the generalized propensity score (GPS) to estimate the average dose-response function (aDRF) and quantify attributable deaths under different counterfactual scenarios of air pollution reduction. We applied the proposed approach to assess the impact of airborne particles with a diameter less than or equal to 10 μm (PM10) on deaths from natural, cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the city of Milan, Italy (2003-2006).
Results: As opposed to what is commonly assumed, the estimated aDRFs were not linear, being steeper for low-moderate values of exposure. In the case of natural mortality, the curve became flatter for higher levels; this behavior was less pronounced for cause-specific mortality. The effect was larger in days characterized by higher temperature. According to the curves, we estimated that a hypothetical intervention able to set the daily exposure levels exceeding 40 μg/m3 to exactly 40 would have avoided 1157 deaths (90\%CI: 689, 1645) in the whole study period, 312 of which for respiratory causes and 771 for cardiovascular causes. These impacts were higher than those obtained previously from regression-based methods.
Conclusion: This novel method based on the GPS allowed estimating the average dose-response function and calculating attributable deaths, without requiring strong assumptions about the shape of the relationship. Its potential as a tool for investigating effect modification by temperature and its use in other environmental epidemiology contexts deserve further investigation.},

We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

Furthermore, we ﬁnd that young individuals, an arguably healthy age group, exhibit economically meaningful responses to air pollution with an eﬀect ranging between 0.45 and 1.04. Our results imply a large role of avoidance behavior driving heterogeneous marginal health eﬀects. Total daily costs of a one standard deviation increase in PM10 represent 0.5\% of the total daily health expenditure, and 85\% of this additional spending comes from more patients hospitalized, while the remaining 15\% can be attributable to more costly, and likely more complex, hospitalizations.},

We find that higher levels of at least two air pollutants, ozone and sulfur dioxide, lead to more respiratory-related emergency admissions. Children and elderly are mostly affected. Carbon monoxide increases emergency admissions for cardiovascular diseases while particulate matter is found responsible for increasing the cardiovascular-related mortality rate, and sulfur dioxide the respiratory-related mortality rate. Assuming a five air pollutants context, we show that an analyst who ignored the presence of interrelations between air pollutants would have reached partially false conclusions.},

In particular, we investigate changes in respiratory hospitalization rates due to increases in PM10 and O 3 concentrations. To address the endogeneity of air pollution, this paper applies the historical average concentration of air pollution, which includes rich information about the meteorological and geographical factors that affect regional air pollution levels, as an instrumental variable and compares the results with other count data models. We find that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 and a 10 ppb increase in O 3 lead to an increase in daily respiratory hospital visits of up to 10.39\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.04–16.80] and 10.93\% (95\% CI 9.23–12.63), resulting in additional health care costs of US\$67 million and US\$70 million, respectively. This paper also shows that the effects of PM10 and O 3 are elevated in highly populated cities, children, and patients without chronic respiratory diseases.},

This study estimates the shortterm health care cost impacts of air pollution using a meteorological phenomenon—thermal inversion—as an instrumental variable for air quality. Using information on outpatient care for respiratory diseases from universal health insurance claim data in Taiwan during 2006–2012, our estimates suggest that a one‐unit reduction in the air quality index (AQI) leads to NT\$2.3 billion (nearly US\$74 million) of savings in respiratory‐related outpatient expenditure per year. Given that the average AQI is equal to 32 during our study period, completely removing air pollution would reduce the national health expenditure by approximately 8\% annually. Our results provide the important implication that the cost of controlling air pollutant emissions can be offset by curtailing health care expenditure.},

In this article we examine a policy implemented by the Government of Chile that uses temporary measures to reduce the severity and negative health impacts of poor air quality in the short run. This policy involves the announcement of “Environmental Episodes” on days forecast to have particularly poor air quality. Such Episode announcements trigger a number of government protocols and public notices intended to both improve regional air quality and encourage avoidance behaviors among the populace. By comparing days on which Episodes were announced to observationally similar days before the policy was fully implemented, we demonstrate that the announcement of an Environmental Episode reduces ambient concentrations of particulate matter in the Santiago Metropolitan Region by approximately 20\% on the day of implementation, with effects persisting into subsequent days. We also ﬁnd that the temporary restrictions, government actions, and informational campaigns that make up an Episode reduce mortality among the elderly on the day-of and days-after Episode implementation. Our ﬁndings suggest that the Environmental Episode program effectively addresses poor air quality in the short term and could serve as a valuable model for policymakers seeking to augment long-term air quality strategies with a means of addressing temporary spikes in local or regional air pollution levels.},

	abstract = {Multicity time series studies of particulate matter and mortality and morbidity have provided evidence that daily variation in air pollution levels is associated with daily variation in mortality counts. These ﬁndings served as key epidemiological evidence for the recent review of the US national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter. As a result, methodological issues concerning time series analysis of the relationship between air pollution and health have attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc community and critics have raised concerns about the adequacy of current model formulations. Time series data on pollution and mortality are generally analysed by using log-linear, Poisson regression models for overdispersed counts with the daily number of deaths as outcome, the (possibly lagged) daily level of pollution as a linear predictor and smooth functions of weather variables and calendar time used to adjust for timevarying confounders. Investigators around the world have used different approaches to adjust for confounding, making it difﬁcult to compare results across studies. To date, the statistical properties of these different approaches have not been comprehensively compared. To address these issues, we quantify and characterize model uncertainty and model choice in adjusting for seasonal and long-term trends in time series models of air pollution and mortality. First, we conduct a simulation study to compare and describe the properties of statistical methods that are commonly used for confounding adjustment. We generate data under several confounding scenarios and systematically compare the performance of the various methods with respect to the mean-squared error of the estimated air pollution coefﬁcient. We ﬁnd that the bias in the estimates generally decreases with more aggressive smoothing and that model selection methods which optimize prediction may not be suitable for obtaining an estimate with small bias. Second, we apply and compare the modelling approaches with the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study database which comprises daily time series of several pollutants, weather variables and mortality counts covering the period 1987–2000 for the largest 100 cities in the USA. When applying these approaches to adjusting for seasonal and long-term trends we ﬁnd that the Study’s estimates for the national average effect of PM10 at lag 1 on mortality vary over approximately a twofold range, with 95\% posterior intervals always excluding zero risk.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-021-01471-y},
	abstract = {Background:  Reliable evaluations of state-level policies are essential for identifying effective policies and informing policymakers’ decisions. State-level policy evaluations commonly use a difference-in-differences (DID) study design; yet within this framework, statistical model specification varies notably across studies. More guidance is needed about which set of statistical models perform best when estimating how state-level policies affect outcomes.
Methods:  Motivated by applied state-level opioid policy evaluations, we implemented an extensive simulation study to compare the statistical performance of multiple variations of the two-way fixed effect models traditionally used for DID under a range of simulation conditions. We also explored the performance of autoregressive (AR) and GEE models. We simulated policy effects on annual state-level opioid mortality rates and assessed statistical performance using various metrics, including directional bias, magnitude bias, and root mean squared error. We also reported Type I error rates and the rate of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., power), given the prevalence of frequentist null hypothesis significance testing in the applied literature.
Results:  Most linear models resulted in minimal bias. However, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to 160\%). Further, root mean square error was minimized by linear AR models when we examined crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when we examined raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis ({\textless} 10\%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy effectiveness in the opioid literature. When considering performance across models, the linear AR models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates.
Conclusions:  The findings highlight notable limitations of commonly used statistical models for DID designs, which are widely used in opioid policy studies and in state policy evaluations more broadly. In contrast, the optimal model we identified--the AR model--is rarely used in state policy evaluation. We urge applied researchers to move beyond the classic DID paradigm and adopt use of AR models.},

These airports are some of the largest sources of air pollution in the US, and they experience large changes in daily air pollution emissions depending on the amount of time planes spend idling on the tarmac. Excess airplane idling, measured as residual daily taxi time, is due to network delays originating in the Eastern US. This idiosyncratic variation in daily airplane taxi time signiﬁcantly impacts the health of local residents, largely driven by increased levels of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. We use this variation in daily airport congestion to estimate the population doseresponse of health outcomes to daily CO exposure, examining hospitalization rates for asthma, respiratory, and heart-related emergency room admissions. A one standard deviation increase in daily pollution levels leads to an additional \$540 thousand in hospitalization costs for respiratory and heart-related admissions for the 6 million individuals living within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the airports in California. These health effects occur at levels of CO exposure far below existing Environmental Protection Agency mandates, and our results suggest there may be sizable morbidity beneﬁts from lowering the existing CO standard.},

	abstract = {Background: Although many time-series studies have established associations of daily pollution variations with daily deaths, there are fewer at low concentrations, or focused on locally generated pollution, which is becoming more important as regulations reduce regional transport. Causal modeling approaches are also lacking.
Objective: We used causal modeling to estimate the impact of local air pollution on mortality at low concentrations.
Methods: Using an instrumental variable approach, we developed an instrument for variations in local pollution concentrations that is unlikely to be correlated with other causes of death, and examined its association with daily deaths in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. We combined height of the planetary boundary layer and wind speed, which affect concentrations of local emissions, to develop the instrument for particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) variations that were independent of year, month, and temperature. We also used Granger causality to assess whether omitted variable confounding existed.
Results: We estimated that an interquartile range increase in the instrument for local PM2.5 was associated with a 0.90\% increase in daily deaths (95\% CI: 0.25, 1.56). A similar result was found for BC, and a weaker association with NO2. The Granger test found no evidence of omitted variable confounding for the instrument. A separate test confirmed the instrument was not associated with mortality independent of pollution. Furthermore, the association remained when all days with PM2.5 concentrations {\textgreater} 30 μg/m3 were excluded from the analysis (0.84\% increase in daily deaths; 95\% CI: 0.19, 1.50).
Conclusions: We conclude that there is a causal association of local air pollution with daily deaths at concentrations below U.S. EPA standards. The estimated attributable risk in Boston exceeded 1,800 deaths during the study period, indicating that important public health benefits can follow from further control efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have long associated PM2:5 with daily mortality, but few applied causal-modeling methods, or at low exposures. Short-term exposure to NO2, a marker of local traﬃc, has also been associated with mortality but is less studied. We previously found a causal eﬀect between local air pollution and mortality in Boston.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the causal eﬀects of local pollution, PM2:5, and NO2 on mortality in 135 U.S. cities.
METHODS: We used three methods which, under diﬀerent assumptions, provide causal marginal estimates of eﬀect: a marginal structural model, an instrumental variable analysis, and a negative exposure control. The instrumental approach used planetary boundary layer, wind speed, and air pressure as instruments for concentrations of local pollutants; the marginal structural model separated the eﬀects of NO2 from the eﬀects of PM2:5, and the negative exposure control provided protection against unmeasured confounders.
RESULTS: In 7.3 million deaths, the instrumental approach estimated that mortality increased 1.5\% [95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.1\%, 2.0\%] per 10 lg=m3 increase in local pollution indexed as PM2:5. The negative control exposure was not associated with mortality. Restricting our analysis to days with PM2:5 below 25 lg=m3, we found a 1.70\% (95\% CI 1.11\%, 2.29\%) increase. With marginal structural models, we found positive signiﬁcant increases in deaths with both PM2:5 and NO2. On days with PM2:5 below 25 lg=m3, we found a 0.83\% (95\% CI 0.39\%, 1.27\%) increase. Including negative exposure controls changed estimates minimally.
CONCLUSIONS: Causal-modeling techniques, each subject to diﬀerent assumptions, demonstrated causal eﬀects of locally generated pollutants on daily deaths with eﬀects at concentrations below the current EPA daily PM2:5 standard. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2732},

	abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Air pollution data in Bangkok, Thailand, indicate that levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm (PM10) are signiﬁcantly higher than in most cities in North America and Western Europe, where the health effects of PM10 are well documented. However, the pollution mix, seasonality, and demographics are different from those in developed Western countries. It is important, therefore, to determine whether the large metropolitan area of Bangkok is subject to similar effects of PM10.
OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the mortality risk from air pollution in Bangkok, Thailand.
METHODS: The study period extended from 1999 to 2003, for which the Ministry of Public Health provided the mortality data. Measures of air pollution were derived from air monitoring stations, and information on temperature and relative humidity was obtained from the weather station in central Bangkok. The statistical analysis followed the common protocol for the multicity PAPA (Public Health and Air Pollution Project in Asia) project in using a natural cubic spline model with smooths of time and weather.
RESULTS: The excess risk for non-accidental mortality was 1.3\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.8–1.7] per 10 µg/m3 of PM10, with higher excess risks for cardiovascular and above age 65 mortality of 1.9\% (95\% CI, 0.8–3.0) and 1.5\% (95\% CI, 0.9–2.1), respectively. In addition, the effects from PM10 appear to be consistent in multipollutant models.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest strong associations between several different mortality outcomes and PM10. In many cases, the effect estimates were higher than those typically reported in Western industrialized nations.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-069X-11-68},
	abstract = {Background: Estimation of power to assess associations of interest can be challenging for time-series studies of the acute health effects of air pollution because there are two dimensions of sample size (time-series length and daily outcome counts), and because these studies often use generalized linear models to control for complex patterns of covariation between pollutants and time trends, meteorology and possibly other pollutants. In general, statistical software packages for power estimation rely on simplifying assumptions that may not adequately capture this complexity. Here we examine the impact of various factors affecting power using simulations, with comparison of power estimates obtained from simulations with those obtained using statistical software.
Methods: Power was estimated for various analyses within a time-series study of air pollution and emergency department visits using simulations for specified scenarios. Mean daily emergency department visit counts, model parameter value estimates and daily values for air pollution and meteorological variables from actual data (8/1/98 to 7/31/99 in Atlanta) were used to generate simulated daily outcome counts with specified temporal associations with air pollutants and randomly generated error based on a Poisson distribution. Power was estimated by conducting analyses of the association between simulated daily outcome counts and air pollution in 2000 data sets for each scenario. Power estimates from simulations and statistical software (G*Power and PASS) were compared.
Results: In the simulation results, increasing time-series length and average daily outcome counts both increased power to a similar extent. Our results also illustrate the low power that can result from using outcomes with low daily counts or short time series, and the reduction in power that can accompany use of multipollutant models. Power estimates obtained using standard statistical software were very similar to those from the simulations when properly implemented; implementation, however, was not straightforward.
Conclusions: These analyses demonstrate the similar impact on power of increasing time-series length versus increasing daily outcome counts, which has not previously been reported. Implementation of power software for these studies is discussed and guidance is provided.},

We find that both higher levels of air pollution and longer-lasting pollution episodes significantly increase health care visits and medical expenditures. An analysis of multiple-day pollution episodes shows that marginal health care visits and marginal health costs start to increase as the pollution event lasts for consecutive days. Omitting the variation in the magnitude of the marginal effects of pollution exposure over the course of a pollution episode would lead to the underestimation of the total health costs of air pollution. Our findings provide empirical evidence that both the intensity and the duration of pollution episodes are critical considerations when designing policies to reduce the health costs of air pollution.},

	abstract = {Vehicles have recently overtaken coal to become the largest source of air pollution in urban China. Research on mobile sources of pollution has foundered due both to inaccessibility of Chinese data on health outcomes and strong identifying assumptions. To address these, we collect daily ambulance call data from the Beijing Emergency Medical Center and combine them with an idiosyncratic feature of a driving restriction policy in Beijing that references the last digit of vehicles’ license plate numbers. Because the number 4 is considered unlucky by many in China, it tends to be avoided on license plates. As a result, days on which the policy restricts license plates ending in 4 unintentionally allow more vehicles in Beijing. Leveraging this variation, we ﬁnd that traﬃc congestion is ∗This paper is supported by National Science Foundation of China (project codes: 71422013 and 71173130), Harvard Global Institute, Hang Lung Center for Real Estate, Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua University Initiative Scientiﬁc Research Program, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Monte Carlo simulations based upon published regressions show that non-iid error processes in highly leveraged regressions, both prominent features of published work, adversely affect the size and power of IV tests, while increasing the bias and mean squared error of IV relative to OLS. Weak instrument pre-tests based upon F-statistics are found to be largely uninformative of both size and bias. In published papers IV has little power as, despite producing substantively different estimates, it rarely rejects the OLS point estimate or the null that OLS is unbiased, while the statistical significance of excluded instruments is exaggerated.},

	abstract = {Power is an important factor in assessing the likely validity of a statistical estimate. An analysis with low power is unlikely to produce convincing evidence of a treatment effect even when one exists. Of greater concern, a statistically signiﬁcant estimate from a low-powered analysis is likely to misstate the true effect size, including ﬁnding estimates of the wrong sign or that are several times too large. Yet statistical power is rarely reported in published economics work. This is in part because many modern research designs are complex enough that power cannot be easily ascertained using simple formulae. Power can also be difﬁcult to estimate in observational settings. Using an applied example–the link between gaining health insurance and mortality–we conduct a simulated power analysis to outline the importance of power and ways to estimate power in complex research settings. We ﬁnd that standard difference-indifferences and triple differences analyses of Medicaid expansions using county or state mortality data would need to induce reductions in population mortality of at least 2\% to be well powered. While there is no single, correct method for conducting a simulated power analysis, our manuscript outlines how applied researchers can conduct simulations appropriate to their settings.},

  abstract = {In classical statistics, the significance of comparisons (e.g., {\texttheta}1- {\texttheta}2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero, which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or negative, and, based on the data, you can state ``{\texttheta}1 {$>$} {\texttheta}2 with confidence,'' ``{\texttheta}2 {$>$} {\texttheta}1 with confidence,'' or ``no claim with confidence.'' We focus on the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim ``{\texttheta}1 {$>$} {\texttheta}2 with confidence'' when {\texttheta}2{$>$} {\texttheta}1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian confidence statements and find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison situations, the conclusions are similar.},

  abstract = {The regression discontinuity (RD) design offers identification of causal effects under weak assumptions, earning it a position as a standard method in modern political science research. But identification does not necessarily imply that causal effects can be estimated accurately with limited data. In this paper, we highlight that estimation under the RD design involves serious statistical challenges and investigate how these challenges manifest themselves in the empirical literature in political science. We collect all RD-based findings published in top political science journals in the period 2009--2018. The distribution of published results exhibits pathological features; estimates tend to bunch just above the conventional level of statistical significance. A reanalysis of all studies with available data suggests that researcher discretion is not a major driver of these features. However, researchers tend to use inappropriate methods for inference, rendering standard errors artificially small. A retrospective power analysis reveals that most of these studies were underpowered to detect all but large effects. The issues we uncover, combined with well-documented selection pressures in academic publishing, cause concern that many published findings using the RD design may be exaggerated.},
