<p>In this document, we carry out a retrospective power analysis of the causal inference literature on the acute health effects of air pollution.</p>
<p>We used an extensive search strategy on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>, and <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/">IDEAS</a> to retrieve studies that (i) focus on the short-health effects of air pollution on mortality and morbidity outcomes, and (ii) rely on a causal inference method. We exclude the very recent literature on the effects of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes. We found a corpus of 36 relevant articles. For each study, we retrieved the method used by the authors, which health outcome and air pollutant they consider, the point estimate and the standard error of results. We coded all main results but also those on heterogeneous effects by age categories and control outcomes (“placebo tests”).</p>
<p>Our document is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the first section, we describe the coded variables and explain how we standardize effect sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second section, we provide two pieces of evidence for publication bias in the literature.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third section, we compute the statistical power, the exaggeration and the probability to make a type S error for each paper using different guesses of true effect sizes. For this task, we rely on the very convenient <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/retrodesign/vignettes/Intro_To_retrodesign.html">retrodesign</a> package.</p></li>

<p>We retrieved data 537 estimates from 36 articles. For each paper, we coded 25 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>paper_label</code>: the first author and publication date of the article. This is the identifier of a study.</li>
<li><code>paper_estimate_id</code>: this is the unique identifier of a result. The median number of results reported by studies is 11.</li>
<li><code>url</code>: the internet link of the publication.</li>
<li><code>publication_year</code>: year of publication. Papers we consider were published between 2011 and 2022.</li>
<li><code>field</code>: whether the variable was published in economics or in epidemiology. 78 of studies are published in economics journals, the rest being published in epidemiology/public health journals.</li>
<li><code>context</code>: the location of the study.</li>
<li><code>empirical_strategy</code>: the empirical strategy used by researchers (“conventional time series model”, “reduced-form”, “difference-in-differences,”instrumental variable”, etc…). We display below the 5 most used empirical strategies for our 537 estimates:</li>

<li><code>outcome</code>: the health outcome studied.</li>
<li><code>outcome_type</code>: whether the health outcome is a mortality or morbidity outcome. 43% of outcomes are related to mortality.</li>
<li><code>outcome_subgroup</code>: indicates which age group is studied.</li>
<li><code>control_outcome</code>: dummy equals to 1 if the health outcome is an outcome that should not be affected by the treatment of interest.</li>
<li><code>independent_variable</code>: the treatment of interest.</li>
<li><code>temporal_scale</code>: indicates at which temporal scale data are recorded (e.g., at the daily level).</li>
<li><code>sample_size</code>: number of observations.</li>
<li><code>increase_independent_variable</code>: the increase in the independent variable considered (e.g., a 1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu g/m^3\)</span> increase in an air pollutant concentration).</li>
<li><code>independent_variable_dummy</code>: indicates whether the independent variable is binary. 27% of estimates are for a binary treatment.</li>
<li><code>standardized_effect</code>: indicates whether the estimates have already been standardized. 3% of estimates are already standardized.</li>
<li><code>log_outcome</code>: is the estimate expressed in relative term. 25% of estimates represent relative increase in the health outcome.</li>
<li><code>mean_outcome</code> and <code>sd_outcome</code>: the average and the standard deviation of the outcome.</li>
<li><code>mean_independant_variable</code> and <code>sd_independent_variable</code>: the average and standard deviation of the treatment of interest.</li>

<li><code>first_stage_statistic</code>: the first stage <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic.</li>
<li><code>source_summary_stats</code>: where we retrieve in the paper the figures on the average and standard deviation of variables.</li>
<li><code>source_results</code>: where we retrieve in the paper the figures on the estimates and standard errors.</li>
<li><code>remarks</code>: remarks on whether we have to do some computations on our own to retrieve the relevant information. For instance, we had to infer for very few papers the mean and standard deviation of a pollutant or an health outcome with statistics such as the median and the quartiles. We use the formula found <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/256456/how-to-calculate-mean-and-standard-deviation-from-median-and-quartiles">here</a>.</li>
<li><code>open_data</code>: whether the data are available to reproduce the findings of the study. Only 12% of results are directly reproducible.</li>

<h3 id="computing-standardized-effect-sizes">Computing Standardized Effect Sizes</h3>
<p>We standardize the effect sizes using the standard deviations of the independent and outcome variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we denote <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{unstandardized}\)</span> the unstandardized estimate, SD<span class="math inline">\(_{X}\)</span> the standard deviation of the treatment and SD<span class="math inline">\(_{Y}\)</span> the standard deviation of the health outcome, the standardized estimate is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{standardized} = \beta \times \frac{SD_{X}}{SD_{Y}}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The standardized standard error SE<span class="math inline">\(_{standardized}\)</span> is then equal to <span class="math inline">\(SE_{standardized} = SE_{unstandardized} \times \frac{\beta_{standardized}}{\beta_{unstandardized}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case where authors used linear regression models with log-transformed variables, we rely on the formulas provided by <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0322-8#Sec8">Rodríguez-Barranco et al. (2017)</a> to standardize the effect size.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

<p>We are able to standardize the effects of 63% of all estimates. We display below summary statistics on the distribution of the standardized effect sizes of causal inference methods:</p>

<p>We see that half of the studies estimated effect sizes below 0.03 standard deviation.</p>
<p>We plot below the ratio of 2SLS estimates over OLS estimates:</p>

<p>For half of the studies reporting both an IV estimate and an OLS estimate, the ratio of these respective estimates is larger than 3.8. The median ratio of the ratio of the standard errors is 3.8.</p>
<h1 id="evidence-of-publication-bias">Evidence of Publication Bias</h1>
<h3 id="distribution-of-t-statistics">Distribution of t-statistics</h3>
<p>We plot the distribution of weighted t-statistics by following <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190687">Brodeur et al. (2020)</a> where the weights are equal to the inverse of the number of tests presented in the same table multiplied by the inverse of the number of tables in the article.</p>

<h1 id="computing-statistical-power-exaggeration-and-type-s-errors">Computing Statistical Power, Exaggeration and Type S Errors</h1>
<p>In this section, we compute the statistical power, the exaggeration ratio and the probability to make a type S error for each study. We rely on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/retrodesign/vignettes/Intro_To_retrodesign.html">retrodesign</a> package.</p>
<p>To compute the three metrics, we need to make an assumption about the true effect size of each study:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we assess whether the design of each study would be robust enough to detect an effect size that is a bit lower than the observed estimate.</li>
<li>Second, for instrumental variable strategy, we take the OLS estimate as the true value of the 2SLS causal estimand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We define the true effect sizes as a decreasing fraction of the estimates. We want to see how the overall distributions of the three metrics evolve with as we decrease the hypothesized true effect size.</p>

<h3 id="ols-estimates-as-true-effect-sizes">OLS Estimates as True Effect Sizes</h3>
<p>For statistically significant 2SLS estimates, we define the true values of effect size as the corresponding OLS estimates. We assume that (i) the causal estimand targeted by the naive and instrumental variable strategy is the same (i.e., we are in the case of homogeneous constant treatment effects), (ii) that there are no omitted variables and (iii) no classical measurement errors in the air pollution exposure.</p>
<p>We retrieve 98 2SLS estimates that were statistically significant at the 5% level and had</p>

<p>The median statistical power is 8.4% and the median exaggeration ratio is 4.5. 2.04% of IV designs have adequate power (<em>i.e.</em> greater than 80%).</p>
