Hi and welcome!

This is the website for the paper [Accurate Estimation of Small Effects: Illustration Through Air Pollution and Health](inference_pollution_paper.pdf). It gathers the paper, all the code and some additional material.

In this paper, I assess the ability of various research designs in measuring small effects, that of air pollution on health in the short-term.
